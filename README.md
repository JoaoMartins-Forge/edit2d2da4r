# Description

This repo contains two projects that you can use to draw modelcurves in your Revit file from Viewer.

Both are under edit2d2da4r folder:

- DrawPolyLine project is a appbundle that takes the inputs (file, points and Revit view name) and generates a new .rvt file with the curves added. To take advantage of the simpleviewer project you'll need this appbundle available under your APS account.
- simpleviewer is a project that leverages [Simple Viewer Tutorial](https://forge-tutorials.autodesk.io/tutorials/simple-viewer/) with a few modifications in order to triger a DA4R workitem from a polyline drawn in Viewer scene using the [Edit2D Extension](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/advanced_options/edit2d-setup/). To make this work, you need to draw the polilyne inside a viewport from a sheet view (and the view from the viewport need to be available as a translated viewable of the input model).
Before taking advantage of this sample, you need to create an appbundle with the content from the DrawPolyLine project in this repo (feel free to modify it's logic').

The proccess is just like in the diagram below.

Go throw each project folder to get more details.
